I woke up to the smell of someone’s cooking three days in a row, and I’ve lived alone since the falling out I had with my roommate.
The first morning, the strong aroma of garlic and sweet, herby tomatoes cleared the sleep from my eyes.
The second morning I took a whiff and thought of steak and potatoes, when the night before I’d cooked salmon.
I’d drifted off amidst an apartment brimming at every corner with the smell of slightly charred fish flesh.
